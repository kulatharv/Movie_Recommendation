# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering
- Project Overview

      The Movie Recommendation System is designed to suggest movies to users based on their interests by analyzing historical user rating data. This project uses      collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique that identifies similarities between movies based on user preferences.
      
      The system helps users discover movies similar to the ones they already like and demonstrates the practical application of data analysis and machine learning concepts using Python.
